# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where a button is styled using Tailwind classes, but the styling does not appear as expected. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

**Problem:** The button does not have the expected blue background and hover effect. 

**Solution:**  Ensure that your Tailwind configuration is correctly set up and that the Tailwind directives are correctly imported into your project.
